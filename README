Helps bootstrap the erl release used by sinan shell on the latest erlang
release.  The erl release is needed by `sinan shell` for your target erts
version otherwise the shell will fail.

For example, I've installed faxien built for R12B5 and sinan built for R12B5
but the erl release is not available for R12B5.  If I have that erlang release
installed you can use this bootstrapper to make the erl release yourself
allowing you to use the `sinan shell` command.

Run ./bootstrap and it will bootstrap off of `which erl` which should be
the erlang release (ex. /usr/local/lib/erlang).  Adjust your paths if an
older erlware erl binary is shown.

If the release finishes run ./copy as the apropriate user to copy
files over to your erlware directory and try out `sinan shell`.
